<!-- BLOG TEXT STARTS HERE -->
                        A fortnight ago I attended a screening of Frozen II on opening night. What I unexpectedly found 
                        in this viewing was the themes of imperialism and cultural appropriation. Indeed, the whole plot
                        of this piece of cinema hinged on tackling these conundrums head-on.
                        <br><br>
                        The story begins with a cliche exposition dump in the form of a bedtime story from the birthgiver
                        of the two main characters, namely Anna and Elsa. The yarn being spun reveals the main conflict of 
                        the film being an unresolved dispute with another, more primitive technologically, nation, which 
                        threatens the livelyhood of the monarchy established in the prequel. Besides this, it already paves way to revealing
                        one of the tactics of colonialists being utilized in the story - historical revisionism. Indeed, as the 
                        monarchs explain the geopolitical situation of their kingdom to their offsprings, they leave out key details such
                        as the very reason for the conflict or which side played the role of the aggresors. As we find out later in the film, 
                        these details have been obscured, as facts would hinder the narrative that the empire attempts to paint of itself as a 
                        beacon of civility and righteousness. 
                        <br><br>
                        As the plot progresses, it is revealed that the motives of the Empire were far from benevolent - they,
                        of course, were the aggresors that had started the conflict, but, even more deviously, it is made clear that 
                        what was presented as a diplomatic gift (The Dam) was indeed a tool of subjugation. Here we observe the main 
                        weakly coated metaphor of imperialism. The Dam, presented as an improvement and way forward to the tribal nation 
                        (stand-in for a third world country), was in fact a tool benefitting the kingdom (the first world capitalist exploiter)
                        and making the subjugated nation more and more relient on their "benefactor". The film further develops this idea by 
                        stating that The Dam must be destroyed to attempt to improve the living conditions of the natives, but that the aftermath
                        of this revolutionary action would also destroy the kingdom of the imperialists. However, earlier in the film it has been 
                        established that the inhabitants of the kingdom are away from the buildings of the kingdom that would be washed away. 
                        <br><br>
                        This juxtaposition leads to a clear interpretation - It is the moral duty of developed nations to stop exploiting the workforce
                        and resources of developing nations, however it would lead to massive changes and destruction of the status quo. However, this 
                        destruction, unlike the subjugatory behaviour overseas, is only expressed over the material, or even more specifically, through 
                        capital. The film presents a realistic overview where the capitalist way of living of the contemporary first world would need to be 
                        rethought if it were ever to free its subjugated, but the society itself can survive and rebuild from these ashes.
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, art for the masses and by the very corporations benefitting from this exploitation cannot fully agree with this 
                        premise, as it would champion its own distruction. Thus, at the very end a saviour of Capital in the form of all-powerful Elsa is 
                        introduced, which nulls the drawback of destruction to the kingdom. Although we as viewers cannot comprehend how dire the stakes of this 
                        scenario truly are, the Shareholder, the Investor, the Corporate cannot accept the distruction of its overfed Maloc - capital, laid ruin. 
                        Therefore from a revolutionary message we are lead to a revolution-presenting conformist message.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, it can be argued that with the character of Elsa and her arc the film presents an additional message of 
                        neoliberalism. It is revealed that the sisters are of mixed descent with parents from both the colonialists and natives. This is presented
                        in the film as a "bridge" between two nations. What happens in the end is that the same monarchy reigns in both countries at the end, with
                        the justification that this parentage makes the sisters "one of them". Obviously false, being raised by and in the nation of subjugators,
                        and serving the very monarchy that had subjugated the natives in the first place, these sisters are merely a happy face on the old machine of
                        Violence. 
                        <br><br>
                        In the end, it is optimistic to expect an utterly commercial product to have a revolutionary message, however, Frozen II strayed strangely close 
                        until backpedalling into the comfort of its corporate overlords.
